# Origin Story
Originally from Whitby, Ontario, I went to the University of Waterloo for my undergrad and masters in Computer Science. While I was there I did the co-op program and worked at [The Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/) and [Google](https://google.ca/).

My master’s thesis was about [using Wikipedia to better extract info for question answering](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/3687).

When I was done school I moved to Vancouver to work at a greentech startup then at [SAP](https://sap.com/) before starting my own startup at the (now defunct) [Growlab accelerator](https://biv.com/article/2014/08/vancouvers-growlab-merges-with-toronto-start-up-ac). That startup was a geo-local-mobile one (all the rage in 2011) which failed.

While working on [MapDash](http://mapdash.com/), we started on a notification-based publishing solution for Instagram and we made “latergram” at a hackathon in late 2013.

We launched “latergramme” in spring 2014 and the founders went full-time on it in early 2015 which was rebranded to [Later](https://later.com) in spring 2016. The rest is in my GIT commit logs.

I’ve also been an Instructor at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) (both web and iOS) and am a pretty big hackathon enthusiast.
